## 🌸 If Data Could Speak

> “The day I was told I had PCOS, the world didn’t stop — but my sense of control did.  
> I began tracking everything: my cycles, temperatures, OPK, symptoms, food.  
> Each data point felt like a small prayer — to understand my body and find patterns that I would make sense to me.”

I started this project not just as an aspiring data scientist,  
but as someone living *inside* the data.

PCOS is unpredictable — cycles stretch and shrink, hormones swing, emotions follow.  
But beneath that chaos, there are stories shared by thousands of women like me:  
on Tiktok, Instagram, Reddit threads, late-night blogs, and whispered chats between appointments.

I wanted to listen, be inspired and find hope
To use Natural Language Processing not as a cold algorithm,  
but as a tool for empathy — a way to let data **echo the voices** of those who's struggle is unseen.

Each sentence in this project belongs to a woman who asked,  
“Is anyone else feeling this too?”  
And each insight is a reminder that we are not alone in our search for balance,  
for understanding, and — for many of us — for hope to hold new life someday.

> *This notebook begins my journey to merge clinical care, coding, and compassion.  
> It’s more than a project — it’s part of healing.*

## 💡 Motivation

> “As a healthcare worker, I often see how data can reveal what words cannot.  
> I wanted to use data science not just to study PCOS, but to *listen* to the women experiencing it.”

Many PCOS patients describe feelings of:
- Frustration with unclear diagnosis  
- Confusion about treatment options  
- Emotional exhaustion from chronic symptoms  
- Hope and motivation shared within peer communities  

This project transforms those online stories into *data-driven empathy.*
